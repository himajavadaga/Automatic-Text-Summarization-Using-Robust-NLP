  an article in the times last week described the experience of 23-year-old kelsey griffith
 she currently earns a meager wage as a restaurant worker and owes $120,000 in student loans for an undergraduate degree from ohio northern university, a college whose recent graduates are among the most indebted in the country
  nationally, about two-thirds of bachelor�s degree recipients now borrow from either public or private lenders, up significantly from the early �90s, when about 45 percent of graduates borrowed from all sources, including family
 griffith�s debt was worsened by the fact that she changed majors and took five years to graduate
 griffith voiced an increasingly common sentiment when she told the times: �i knew a private school would cost a lot of money
 but, when i graduate, i�m going to owe like $900 a month

 letters informing them about financial aid awards often blur the distinction between loans and grants to make the school look like a better deal than it is
  the obama administration has taken some important steps to address these problems
 later this year, it plans to post an internet �scorecard� that rates each college nationally on affordability and value � defined by graduation rates and whether graduates earn enough on average to repay their debts
